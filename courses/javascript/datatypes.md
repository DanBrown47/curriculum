A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. It can be a `string` or a `number` or of any other type.

There are **eight basic data types** in JavaScript. A varaible can store any such value. It can store a string at one moment and then store a number later.

```javascript
let message = "hello";
message = 123456;
```

Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called **“dynamically typed”**, meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.

## Number

The _`number`_ type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

```javascript
let n = 123;
n = 12.345;
```

## String

The _`string`_ in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes. In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes. Double quotes "" , Single quotes '' and Backticks \`\`\. Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript. Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in  `${…}` , for example:

```javascript
let str = "Hello"; // Hello
let str2 = "Single quotes are ok too"; // Single quotes are ok too
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`; // can embed another Hello
let result = `the result is ${1 + 2}`; // the result is 3   
```

## Boolean

The boolean type has only two values: `true` and `false`. This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: `true` means “yes, correct”, and `false` means “no, incorrect”.

```javascript
let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked
```

## Complete the tasks below:

- Create a variable `num` of type `let` and value 101

- Create variable `str` of type `let` and value "hello"

- Create a variable `flag` of type `let` and value `true`
