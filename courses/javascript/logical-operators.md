There are four logical operators in JavaScript: `||` (OR), `&&` (AND), `!` (NOT), `??` (Nullish Coalescing).
Although they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type.

## OR ||

The “OR” operator is represented with two vertical line symbols `||` :

```javascript
result = a || b;
```

In classical programming, the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. If any of its arguments are `true`, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.
There are four possible logical combinations:

```javascript
console.log(true || true); // true
console.log(false || true); // true
console.log(true || false); // true
console.log(false || false); // false
```

As we can see, the result is always `true` except for the case when both operands are `false`.

## AND &&

The AND operator is represented with two ampersands `&&`:

```javascript
result = a && b;
```

In classical programming, AND returns `true` if both operands are truthy and `false` otherwise:

```javascript
console.log(true && true); // true
console.log(false && true); // false
console.log(true && false); // false
console.log(false && false); // false
```

An example with if:

```javascript
let hour = 12;
let minute = 30;

if (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {
  console.log("The time is 12:30");
}
```

## ! NOT

The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign `!`.

```javascript
result = !value;
```

The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

- Converts the operand to boolean type: `true`/`false`.
- Returns the inverse value.

### Example:

```javascript
console.log(!true); // false
console.log(!0); // true
```

## Complete the tasks below:

- Create two variables `a` and `b` and assign values `true` and `false` respectively.

- Perform an AND operation on `a`and `b` and assign the value to a variable `result`.

- Perform an OR operation on `a` and `b` and assign the value to `result`.

- Perform a NOT operation on `a` and assign the value to `result`.
